# Exact TorchLean backward integration

This separate Lean package uses real upstream TorchLean at the revision pinned in
`lakefile.toml`; `lake-manifest.json` fixes its transitive dependencies. Its Lean
4.34 toolchain matches the root PTX project. A local path dependency imports the
actual root `ptxlean` package alongside TorchLean in the same Lean build.

The example computes `(x * weight + bias)^2` independently at each coordinate of
an arbitrary tensor shape. It is a diagonal affine map followed by squaring, not
a dense matrix layer. All three tensors are variable inputs, so the generated
backward computation includes weight and bias sensitivities. The seed is an
arbitrary output-shaped tensor. No backward formula is implemented here:
TorchLean composes the existing primitive reverse rules.

`PtxTorchLean.lean` contains:

- `affineSquare`: an upstream `DGraph` built from multiplication, addition and
  square nodes, with upstream local derivative certificates.
- `forward_polynomial`: the selected graph forward value at every coordinate
  equals `(x_i * weight_i + bias_i)^2`, independently of the VJP theorem.
- `checked_success`: the actual checked graph interface returns `.ok` for every
  real-valued input and seed. The proof discharges this graph's validation rather
  than assuming execution succeeded.
- `checked_success_vjp`: the returned backward values equal the mathematical VJP
  of the selected graph output. The auxiliary `checked_vjp` exposes the general
  upstream success premise; `checked_success_vjp` discharges it.
- `unsigned_min_scalar_embedding`: a narrow theorem using both libraries. The
  natural-number value of modeled PTX unsigned minimum embeds into a real scalar
  tensor. This does not prove any kernel implements the network graph.
- `exact_tape_success_vjp`: success and the derivative correspondence for the
  lower-level exact tape, including its saved intermediate values.

These are proofs over exact real values. They do not make real numbers executable
hardware values, certify floating-point error, or prove a PTX implementation.
The mathematical VJP endpoint differentiates the actual graph forward map;
`forward_polynomial` establishes its correspondence to the displayed polynomial.
The current graph has no state updates, masks, parameter sharing or nonsmooth
operations. General model lowering and the numerical/kernel bridges remain open.

## Reproduce

From this directory:

```sh
lake build PtxTorchLean
lake env lean PtxTorchLean.lean
```

Elan may download the pinned toolchain on first use. Lake uses the committed
manifest to fetch the exact dependencies. If mathlib artifacts are absent,
`lake exe cache get` fetches its compatible cache. Do not use `lake update` merely
to reproduce a build: that command can change resolved dependencies.

CUDA and LibTorch options are disabled. The focused theorem target avoids the
upstream umbrella library and native executables. Upstream dependencies still
include FloatLib proofs and documentation-package sources. The first completed
build used about 8.9 GB in `.lake`, plus a 2.9 GB Lean toolchain; downloaded mathlib
cache files also occupy the shared user cache.

The build prints the transitive logical dependencies of the graph and its public
endpoints. The verified endpoints use only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and
`Quot.sound`; no `sorryAx` or custom axioms occur in those reports. Logical proofs
do not certify upstream native/executable replacements. The paths claimed here
are the proof-visible exact semantics, not compiled numerical execution.

## Verification history

`verification.json` and `proof-audit.txt` preserve the initial isolated TorchLean
experiment. They identify earlier source hashes and are historical receipts.
The joint build is recorded separately in `verification-joint.json` and
`proof-audit-joint.txt`, including the root PTX source snapshot used in that build.
Neither receipt is a substitute for rerunning checks after changing its inputs.
